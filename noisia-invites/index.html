            <p class="box__p">
            Starting from their studio in their hometown of Groningen, Netherlands, Noisia have gradually developed and cultivated a sound that’s all their own; a sound that’s obsessed with production techniques; a sound that’s instantly recognizable whether you’re hearing three minutes of a Noisia track dropped at a festival or three hours of it while playing Devil May Cry 5.
            </p>
            <p class="box__p">
            Since their first release in 2003, Noisa has been voted Best D&B Act three times over at the Beatport Music Awards, licensed music for numerous video games, and started three record labels: Vision, Division, and Invisible. Having pushed the envelope and successfully managed to blend incredible sound design with unrelenting and uncompromising beats and basslines, Noisia’s sound is undoubtedly unique.
